## Parking Lot
A parking lot is an open area or a designated space where vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and sometimes bicycles, are parked temporarily. It can be found in a variety of settings, including near commercial buildings, residential complexes, shopping malls, airports, and recreational areas. Parking lots are often organized into rows and spaces marked with lines or numbers to designate individual parking spots, making it easier for drivers to park and retrieve their vehicles.

Parking lots can be designed as outdoor or indoor (covered) facilities and can include multiple levels, especially in urban settings where space is limited. Some parking lots are equipped with automated systems for entry and exit, pay stations, security features like cameras, and even electric vehicle charging stations. The layout and size of a parking lot depend on its intended use, capacity requirements, and the volume of traffic it needs to handle.
